# SysLume

<p align="center"><img src="docs/syslume-logo.png" alt="SysLume logo" width="200"></p>

**A local Linux performance dashboard you install by telling your AI coding harness to do it.**

Clone it. Give your coding agent [one setup prompt](SETUP_PROMPT.md). Open your dashboard.
The agent inspects your machine, configures the existing application, and verifies
installation. Once installed, SysLume runs independently of the agent.

- **See your host:** CPU, memory, storage, network, and optional NVIDIA GPU telemetry.
- **Explore real history:** interactive charts, zoom, and 30 days of local measurements.
- **Make it comfortable:** light and dark themes, with a layout that adapts to your screen.
- **Keep it private:** Tailscale by default, or an explicit address on a trusted LAN.

Python standard library, SQLite, and local HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No Python packages,
containers, external web resources, or AI connection needed by the dashboard.
Machine-specific settings live in ignored `config.json`; the application stays reusable.

## Quick start with a coding agent

1. Clone this repository using its GitHub **Code** URL, then enter the directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY-URL> SysLume
   cd SysLume
   ```

   A downloaded ZIP works too: extract it and open the extracted project directory.

2. Open Claude Code, Codex, Pi, or another coding agent in that directory and say:

   > Read SETUP_PROMPT.md and set up SysLume on this machine. Prefer configuration over code changes.

3. The agent checks the host, prepares local configuration, runs tests, installs
   the service, and gives you the private dashboard URL. It asks about network mode
   if Tailscale is unavailable. Installation requires `sudo` access.

The prompt is deliberately short: inspect once, configure what is needed, and use
the existing installer. No generated project scaffolding or agent-specific files.

## What it looks like

Real measurements from one Linux/NVIDIA host; the hostname is anonymized.
Available sensors and readings vary by machine.

Use the **Light / Dark** switch in the top-right corner on either page. The first
visit follows your system theme; your choice is remembered in this browser.
Charts change theme immediately without resetting the selected time range.

## Requirements

- Linux with host metrics in `/proc` and `/sys`.
- Python 3.8+ at `/usr/bin/python3`, with SQLite 3.24+ support.
- systemd and a normal login account for the supplied installer/service.
- Connected Tailscale for the default network mode, or an explicit private LAN IPv4.
- Optional: `nvidia-smi` from an existing NVIDIA driver, or `tegrastats` on Jetson.

A host without an NVIDIA GPU still collects CPU, memory, storage, and network data.
Unsupported readings appear as `—`, not zero.

## Install manually

From the cloned or extracted project directory:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json if this machine needs different settings.
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer validates configuration and runs the tests before replacing application
files. It copies the application into `/opt/syslume`, creates `syslume.service`,
and runs as the account that invoked `sudo`. The installed service is independent
of the checkout: the folder may have any name and can be moved after installation.
For another existing normal account, use `sudo MONITOR_USER=myuser bash install.sh`.

On first installation, your source `config.json` is used, or the example if none
exists. On upgrades, `/opt/syslume/config.json` takes precedence and existing
data is preserved. Edit that installed configuration to change a running service.
The installer does not install drivers, packages, or Tailscale, or change firewall
rules, GPU clocks, or power limits.

## Private network access

**Tailscale (default):** keep `"bind": "tailscale"`. Connect the monitored host and
the viewing device to the same Tailnet with permission to communicate. On the host,
`tailscale ip -4` shows its address. Open `http://<TAILSCALE-IP>:8765/` for current
readings or `http://<TAILSCALE-IP>:8765/history` for history.
The listener uses `tailscale0` directly and waits if it is unavailable; sampling
continues. Use the exact IP and port in the URL.

**Closed LAN:** set `"bind": "192.168.1.50"` in `config.json` before installing,
replacing the example with an IPv4 actually assigned to this host. Open
`http://192.168.1.50:8765/` or `http://192.168.1.50:8765/history` from another device
on the private network. Tailscale is not required in this mode.

LAN binds must be in `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, or `192.168.0.0/16`.
Wildcard, public, and hostname binds are rejected. The dashboard has no login;
use it only on a trusted private network. Do not forward its port to the Internet.
`127.0.0.1` is reserved for development/tests and rejected by the installer.

## Configuration and metrics

See [config.example.json](config.example.json) for every supported setting.

| Setting | Default | When to change it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bind` | `tailscale` | Use an explicit private IPv4 for LAN access |
| `port` | `8765` | Another service already uses this port |
| `storage_path` | `/` | Monitor another filesystem; use an absolute path |
| `network_interfaces` | `[]` | Override automatic selection, e.g. `["enp5s0"]` |
| `nvidia_smi_path` | `auto` | An NVIDIA executable needs an explicit path |
| `tegrastats_path` | `auto` | A Jetson executable needs an explicit path |
| `gpu_index` | `0` | Monitor another available NVIDIA GPU |
| `database` | `data/monitor.db` | Keep this for the supplied service |
| `interval_seconds` | `5` | Sampling interval in seconds |
| `retention_days` | `30` | History retention in days |

Host metrics include total/per-core CPU use, CPU frequency and temperature when
available, RAM/swap, load, uptime, filesystem capacity and block I/O, physical
network and Tailscale traffic, and fan sensors. GPU metrics include utilization,
memory-controller activity, VRAM, temperature, power, clocks, fan, and driver details.

When `nvidia-smi` cannot provide telemetry, GPU index `0` automatically falls back
to an installed `tegrastats`. Its managed child samples at the configured interval;
missing tools, permissions, and stale output leave host monitoring available.
The dashboard and `details.gpu_telemetry` report the selected source's status;
the existing `details.nvidia_smi` status is preserved.
Optional telemetry uses `absent`, `starting`, `ready`, and `error` states. Missing
auto-discovered tools and unsupported sensor fields show `—` without warnings.
Vendor utilities left installed on a host with no matching hardware are quiet too.
Failed tools, invalid explicit tool paths, and stale telemetry still report errors;
a working fallback suppresses errors from the other source. No configuration change
is needed for a host without GPU tools.

Jetson readings follow [NVIDIA's tegrastats field definitions](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r36.5/DeveloperGuide/AT/JetsonLinuxDevelopmentTools/TegrastatsUtility.html):
GPU load, the highest reported GPC clock, valid temperatures, and dedicated GPU
power rails populate equivalent metrics. A discovered GPU devfreq sensor supplies
the clock if omitted by the tool. Shared RAM, system EMC activity, and combined
power rails do not populate VRAM, GPU memory activity, or GPU-only power fields.
EMC and power-rail readings remain in sample details; unsupported metrics show `—`.
The setup prompt also directs coding agents to discover other installed sources
and add small, tested readers when needed, preserving the schema and dependencies.

History supports range presets, custom ranges, pan, drag-to-zoom, Ctrl+wheel zoom,
and reset. Long ranges retain mean/minimum/maximum values so peaks remain visible.

After editing `/opt/syslume/config.json`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart syslume
systemctl status syslume --no-pager
journalctl -u syslume -n 50 --no-pager
```

Use `sudo systemctl stop syslume` or `sudo systemctl start syslume` to stop
or start it. Its database is at `/opt/syslume/data/monitor.db`.

## Test and contribute

Tests need no configuration, NVIDIA GPU, or Tailscale connection. They use temporary
databases and loopback HTTP servers and leave the installed database untouched.

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
bash -n install.sh
```

For a development server, use `python3 -B monitor.py --bind 127.0.0.1` from the
source tree; it creates a local ignored `data/monitor.db`. Stop it with Ctrl+C.
